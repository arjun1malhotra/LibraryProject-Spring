One of my initial adventures with Spring Framework.
Library Management (Spring + Restful APIs) is a web app (micro-service) using Spring Boot, JPA, MySQL and RESTful APIs for Library Management System where a user can search and rent a book (with email notification). Also, an admin can update user's membership and create, update and delete books/users as well.
